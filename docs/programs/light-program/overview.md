## Lifestyle Innovation through God-centered Holistic Training

**LIGHT** (**L**ifestyle **I**nnovation through **G**od-centered **H**olistic **T**raining) is a transformative 5-week program designed for young adults seeking holistic growth in spirit, soul, and body through God-centered living.

:::info Matthew 5:14-16
14. You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.
15. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
16. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.
