## English Lyrics  

**[Joy to the World]**  
Joy to the world, the Lord is come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare Him room  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and heaven and nature sing  
  
**[The First Noel]**  
The first Noel, the angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel  
  
**[Angels We Have Heard on High]**  
Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing o'er the plains  
And the mountains in reply  
Echoing their joyous strains  
Glo-ria, in excelsis Deo  
Glo-ria, in excelsis Deo  
  
**[Hark! the Herald Angels Sing]**  
Hark! the herald angels sing, Glory to the newborn King  
Peace on earth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled  
Joyful, all ye nations, rise, join the triumph of the skies  
with th'angelic hosts proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem  
Hark! the herald angels sing, Glory to the newborn King  

**[O Come, All Ye Faithful]**  
O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant  
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem  
Come, and behold Him, born the King of angels  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him  
O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord  

**[Silent Night]**  
Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
Round yon virgin mother and child  
Holy Infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace
