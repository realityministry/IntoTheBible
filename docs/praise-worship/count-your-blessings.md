# Count Your Blessings

<h3>Johnson Oatman</h3>

## English Lyrics

**[Opening]**  
One two three, One two and three four (x2)  

**[Verse]**  
When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed  
When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost  
Count your many blessings, name them one by one  
And it will surprise you what the Lord has done  

**[Chorus]**  
Count your blessings, name them one by one  
Count your blessings, see what God has done  
Count your blessings, name them one by one  
Count your many blessings, see what God has done
