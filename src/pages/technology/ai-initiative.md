# AI Initiative

<h3>June 1, 2023</h3>

Dear fellow Christians around the world,

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has now reached a stage where its impact on our lives is undeniably remarkable. The recent emergence of AI systems based on large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, revolutionizes the way humans think and process. Unlike previous AI technologies that adhere to predetermined protocols, LLMs represent a pioneering breakthrough and instill confidence in Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers, including myself, that AI can truly comprehend human languages and autonomously produce useful content for a wide range of domains, which completely transforms how we approach and execute our tasks.

Instead of searching for specific information by using search engines, browsing webpages for relevant content, and inferring what is needed manually, AI can streamline these processes for you, allowing you to acquire the information without going through those steps. Even when it comes to writing, once you have determined your key points, you can ask AI to gather supporting evidence and expertly organize them into coherent explanations with persuasive language. As AI becomes deeply ingrained in our thinking process, it inevitably influences our values, beliefs, and decision-making, akin to the profound impact we have already witnessed through media, although the potential for its influence is exponentially greater than anything that we have experienced before.

Since the introduction of ChatGPT, the world is swiftly embracing this new technology. These AI systems are trained on extensive amounts of data, encompassing perspectives that may not align with God’s view. With the rapid progression of AI integration, it will soon permeate educational systems and likely shape the minds of our children according to worldly standards. Moreover, given the ubiquitous accessibility of AI to individuals, its influence is poised to be remarkably pervasive. Hence, it is crucial for Christians to recognize this reality and actively pursue the development of AI technologies that adhere to God’s principles.

Numerous Christian communities have devoted themselves to the creation and dissemination of content aimed at spreading the ”good news” to people worldwide, that is “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16). These invaluable resources have been utilized in various ministries. I firmly believe in the potential to create AI technologies that are in harmony with our faith by training them solely on data in accordance with our beliefs. It is our mission to equip ourselves with godly AI, preparing us for spiritual battles against worldly AIs before they reach maturity. The responsibility lies with us to ensure that the next generation is provided with AI systems they can trust, just as they trust good teachers, safeguarding their spiritual well-being.

This mission can only be accomplished by a community, headed by Jesus Christ and moved by the Holy Spirit. As a first step, we aspire to build an LLM exclusively trained on Christian content. If you wish to support this mission, we kindly request you to reach out and contribute in any way you can, including:

* Providing textual data such as sermons, bible studies, books, and other relevant resources.
* Offering financial assistance to hire developers and acquire high-performance computing devices.
* Volunteering your time and expertise to collaborate in the development process.

Thank you for taking the time to read, and may the love and grace of God be with you always.

**Sincerely,**
